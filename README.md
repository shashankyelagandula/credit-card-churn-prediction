# Credit Card Churn Prediction

## Project Title
**Predicting Credit Card Account Cancellations**

## Introduction
This project is an individual assignment focused on applied data science using a real dataset. The goal is to explore factors leading to credit card account cancellations and to develop machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of future cancellations.

## Data
The `credit_card_df` data frame contains information on over 4,000 customers of a U.S. bank. The bank aims to identify customers at risk of canceling their accounts to minimize financial losses due to declining revenue from account closures.

### Key Questions Addressed:
- **What factors are associated with customers closing their credit card accounts?**
- **Is it possible to predict account closure, and if so, what is the prediction accuracy and expected cost of errors?**
- **What actions or policies can the bank implement to reduce customer churn?**

### Outcome Variable
The `customer_status` variable indicates whether a customer closed their account (`closed_account`, the positive class) or is active.

## Recommendations

### ðŸ“Š Usage Ratio Monitoring
Proactively monitor usage ratios, especially for accounts with ratios less than 25%, to identify and engage at-risk clients. This helps lower acquisition costs and increases customer engagement and retention.

### ðŸŽ“ Improved Customer Education
Provide financial literacy classes or resources to customers with associate's and masterâ€™s degrees to address reasons for account closure. This aims to improve client satisfaction and loyalty, fostering long-lasting partnerships.
